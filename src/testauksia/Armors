Working file format:

1. each item is defined between {} parenthesis. The line with a parenthese cannot have any other characters except whitespace.
2. Key-value pairs are separated with colon ( : ) and every pair on its own line.
3. All whitespace character are erased. 

correctly constructed item:
{
type : armor
name : Super2000
area : 75
agility_bonus : -2
defence_bonus : 0
}
Output:
first key: 'type'	
first value: 'armor'
etc...


incorrectly constructed item:

{	type:armor    
name : Nimbus2000
area : 1
agility_bonus : -2
defence_bonus : 0
}
Output:
nothing. whole section is skipped.
